UNJ Innovation Code Style
=========================

**Only overrides Java (Eclipse and IntelliJ) code style.**

**Main changes:**
* 3.3.3 All imports in a single block (Eclipse has some limitations formatting static/non-static in different blocks)
* 4.2 Block indentation: 4 spaces instead of 2
* 4.4 Column limit: 120 characters instead of 100
* All other changes were necessary to normalize Eclipse's and IntelliJ's formatter.
